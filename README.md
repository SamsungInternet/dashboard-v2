Samsung Internet Dashboard
==========================

**To update the dashboard stats (Samsung Internet team only)**

1. Visit [here](https://samsung-internet-dashboard.glitch.me/admin) and login.
2. Press the 'Update' button to scrape the stats which we can automate.
3. Type in the new values for the individual stats under 'Manual Entry' too.

**To update the Medium graph (Samsung Internet team only)**

(The graph could be removed if this proves burdensome!)

1. If you don't have it already, install the Chrome extension [from here](https://github.com/SamsungInternet/dashboard/tree/master/extension) (NB. I heard only recently that FireFox should support Chrome extensions too? So it might work in FF too...)
2. Visit [the Medium stats overview page](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/stats/overview) and click 'Download overview stats' from the extension poup.
3. Drag the CSV file into [the Glitch project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/samsung-internet-dashboard) and rename it so it goes under the `public/data` directory.


That should be it... Check [the dashboard page](https://samsung-internet-dashboard.glitch.me/) to see the changes.
